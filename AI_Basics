AI -> ML -> DL -> Gen AI

Unlock our phone with Face ID , Ask Siri to "What's weather today ?"
-> We are actually using "Computer Vision" and NLP.

We are using Tools s.a ChatGpt and Gemini -> we are using "LLM(Large language Models)".

Every app is full of recommendations. e.g.Amazon when we use, they recommend us what to buy.
Uber shows traffic prediction, arrival time estimation with great accuracy. 
When we code today -> we take help from GitHub Copilot.

**** Agenda
Core Fundamentals of AI
Types 
Algorithms
Use Cases of AI

***What is AI ?
AI is a technology which allows computers, system perform tasks that typically requires Human intelligence.
e.g.(1) Pattern Recognition.. As a human we are good at understanding the patterns.
1 -> 1
2 -> 4
3 -> 9
It has some pattern as square of the number. This is simple example of pattern recognition. This also we can perform with technology i.e. AI.

e.g.(2) Speech Recognition. with Siri, Alexa,  -> we understand its meaning, context, emotions.
ChatGpt(Voice), Gemini(Voice) -> interact with Voice.

e.g.(3) Image Analysis -> we can understand what different objects has been used, if number is used what are these numbers.
CAr Image -> where is number plate and what is written. Traffic police automatic challan.

*****Machine Learning (One of branch of AI)
Majority of AI which we can see, that AI is machine learning.
ML are those algorithms that learned by using data rather than programming.
Inside ML, data is very important.
Each company has lots of data and that is why we can see so many practical application of ML algorithms.
ML is subdomain of AI. Everything of ML is AI. But everything as AI is not ML. There are some parts of AI which is not ML.

AI = ML(majority), 
     Rule Based systems(here we do programming rather than learning from data), 
     Robotics, 
     A* Algorithms, 
     Fuzzy logic systems(Ac's, Freeze)

Majority of AI is ML -> LLMs, Google Maps, Uber, Amazon, BlinkIt App.
                        ML has different Algorithms. E.g. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tress and so on.
                        ML has subdomain as Deep Learning(which is very popular today)

***Deep Leaning (here we can work on neaural networks)
These neural networks are inspired from human brain. It has different algorithms like  FNN, RNN, CNN, Tranformers used in ChatGPT.

***GenAI (subdomain of DL)
We are dealing with tehnologies generate.

***Machine Learning
Algorithmn we deal here which learned from data. --> 
Step1: Trainig Model 
Step2: Predictions

Home, Car -> loan application apply -> predict whether loan should accepted or rejected by Bank.
-> We can do this by checking old data. 
-> Understand applicant's characteristics, 
-> By using Old data, we understand Which applicant is accepted and rejected.
-> Credit score value, salary, Education level, collateral (multiple characteristics)
--> This is training Step
--> when new applicant -> check parameters -> making predictions
