Question 1: What is ADO.NET?
Answer 1: ADO stands for Active Data Object and ADO.NET is a set of .NET libraries for ADO.

2. ADO.NET provides mainly the following two types of architectures:
Connected Architecture.
Disconnected Architecture.

ADO.NET Namespaces
------------------------------------
Namespaces	Description
System.Data	->  Contains the definition for columns, relations, tables, database, rows, views and constraints.
System.Data.SqlClient -> 	Contains the classes that are used to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database such as SqlCommand, SqlConnection, SqlDataAdapter.
System.Data.Odbc	-> Contains classes required to connect to most ODBC drivers. These classes include OdbcCommand,OdbcConnection.
System.Data.OracleClient -> Contains classes such as OracleConnection,OracleCommand required to connect to an Oracle database.

 3: What are the ADO.NET components?
 4: How can you define the DataSet structure?
 5: What is Connection Pooling in ADO.NET?
 6: What is the differences Between DataReader and DataSet?
 7: What is SqlCommand Object?
  The three important methods exposed by the SqlCommand object is shown below:

ExecuteScalar
ExecuteNonQuery
ExecuteReader

8. What is the difference between ADO and ADO.NET?
9: What is the DataAdapter Object in ADO.NET?
Provider-Specific Data Adapter classes	          Data Source
SqlDataAdapter	                                  SQL Server
OledbDataAdapter	                                OLE DB provider
OdbcDataAdapter	                                  ODBC driver
OracleDataAdapter                                	Oracle
9: Use of DataSet object in ADO.NET?
 10: Describe the System.Data Namespace Class?
 11: What is DataTable in ADO.NET?

protected void BinddataTable()
{
    SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("your database connection string");
    con.Open();
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Write your query or procedure", con);
    SqlDataAdapter da = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd);
    DataTable dt = new DataTable();
    da.Fill(dt);
    grid.DataSource = dt;
    grid.DataBind();
}

 12: What is the DataReader in ADO.Net?
      DataReader holds only one table at a time.
      It only provides read only access mode and cannot write data.
      It is not required local storage to data store.
      Holds one row at a time.
      Uses less memory.
      DataReader do not maintain relation.
  DataReader representation in .aspx.cs code,
  protected void Bind()
{
    SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection("your database connection string ");
    con.Open();
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("Write your query or procedure ", con);
    SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
    grid.DataSource = dr;
    grid.DataBind();
}

13: What is the SqlCommandBuilder?
 14: What is the Connection object in ADO.NET?
15: Describe the DataView in ADO.NET?
16: What is ExecuteScalar method in ADO.NET?
private void frmSqlCommand_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //Sample 03: Open Database Connection
    String con_string = Properties.Settings.Default.ConStrPubs;
    pubs_db_connection = new SqlConnection(con_string);
    pubs_db_connection.Open();
    //Sample 04: Form the Command Object
    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand();
    cmd.CommandText = "Select Count(*) as Count from Titles";
    cmd.Connection = pubs_db_connection;
    //Sample 05: Execute the Command & retrive scalar value
    lblTotal.Text = System.Convert.ToString(cmd.ExecuteScalar());
}

17: What are the methods of DataSet?
Answer: It is used in disconnected architecture. It represent records in the form of Database table (Row and Column) format. 
It stores record of one or more tables.

SqlDataAdapter da;
DataSet ds;
string strconn = "Data Source=YourServerName;Initial Catalog=EMP;Integrated Security=True";
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    da = new SqlDataAdapter("select * from userdet", strconn);
    ds = new System.Data.DataSet();
    da.Fill(ds);
    dataGridView1.DataSource = ds.Tables[0];
}
18. 18: What are Parameters in ADO.NET?
19: What is the difference between DataSet and DataReader?
20 : What you understand by ExecuteNonQuery Method?
21: What do you understand by DataRelation class?
22: How can create a SqlConnection?
SqlConnection obj=new SqlConnection(“Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Table_Name;Data Source=.”);-- for Windows authentication

SqlConnection obj=new SqlConnection(“user id= sa ; Password=sa123;server=.;database=name”); --Sql server Authentication
 23: What are the important classes in ADO.NET?
25: What are the two fundamental objects in ADO.NET?
26: What is DataAdapter and its property?
27: Which namespaces are used for data access?
28: Explain the properties and methods of Command Object.
 29: Explain the ExecuteReader method
