1. With multilevel inheritance, if we call base class method, then what will be output? 

A - B - C

Class A
{ void print() {c.w.();} } 
class B : A
{ void print() {c.w.();} }
Class C : B
{ void print() {c.w.();} }
Main() 
{
   A obj = new A() ;
  // Question? 
  What is the output of this program? 
//what is problem here, here why we use virtual, override. 
} 


2.
Class Program
{
    void main() 
    {
       static int a;
       static CONST b;
      //How these static variable will be called outside the class. 
         Class is not static 
           Method is static or not not sure.??
    } 
}
