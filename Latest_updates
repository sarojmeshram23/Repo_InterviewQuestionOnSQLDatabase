What is MERN Stack ?
The MERN stack is a popular, JavaScript-based collection of technologies used to build dynamic web and mobile applications, standing for
MongoDB (database), 
Express.js (backend framework), 
React (frontend library), and 
Node.js (runtime environment). 

It allows developers to use JavaScript across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, and database) for building full-stack applications.
